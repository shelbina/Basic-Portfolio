		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<img src="assets/images/Snapchat-306152301.jpg" alt="SD">
		<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
		<p>I was born in Detoit and raised in the Detroit area. I have three sisters. My parents got divorced when I was in high school. I visit my mom and sisters a few times a year.</p>
		<p><strong>Education</strong></p>
		<p>After graduating high school I went to a community college and studied pastry arts. After realizing that I didn't want to work in a hot kitchen I changed my major to education. I went to Eastern Michigan University and got by Bachelor's of Science in Elementary and Early Childhood Education. I began teaching and found out about a full scholarship for continuing education. I got my Master's of Education in Leadership, Policy, and Advocacy in Early Childhood and Curriculum, Instruction, and Supervision. While I do have a passion for teaching young children I have decided to change my career and go back to get a certificate in web development.</p>

		<p><strong>Personal Interests</strong></p>
		<p>There are many things that I like to do in my free time. I love working with children so I often babysit for a few different local families. I don't have children of my own. Healthful living is important to me so I enjoy cooking, baking, running, and working out. I have an old cockatiel named Echo and he is my baby. I love talking to him and feeding him spray millet.</p>
